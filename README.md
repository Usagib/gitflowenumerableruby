# Ruby Enumerable methods
A comprehensive rebuild on basic Enumerable methods in Ruby for a better understanding in block passing, enumerator and classes and regular expressions as arguments.

## Update: Added Rspec testing for all methods, check ./spec/enumerable_spec.rb for details.

### Testing project specification can be found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code

### This scripts rebuilds ruby Enumerable methods:

- #each as #my_each
- #each_with_index as #my_each_with_index
- #select as #my_select
- #all? as #my_all?
- #any? as #my_any?
- #none? as #my_none?
- #count as #my_count
- #map as #my_map
- #inject as #my_inject

each of them can be used as default Enumerable methods working the exact same way
